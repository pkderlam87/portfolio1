                <p>I edit the CSS code to keep the same behavior as tablet version. So I deleted some styles, and I
                    adjust

                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The suggestion of the feed back said “it might be better to have a two column layout”. So I followed

                <p>I replaced h3 to buttons and I kept the tablet and mobile style. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The feedback said: “the links on the home page look more like headings than links. In the HTML, they
                    are
                    headings as well. Might be best to keep the two separate”. I agreed before I thought this task
                    couldn’t
                    have buttons because it didn’t have a JavaScript file. Now, I understand it’s much better to use
                    buttons
                    than h3, even though it hasn’t a JavaScript file.</p>

                <p>The CSM now has correct way to use Google Fonts, and it is above my stylesheets.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I deleted the @font-face rules because I’m using Google Fonts, and it isn’t necessary. I created a
                    specific stylesheet to the fonts and font sizes because, eventually, it’s easy to shift some value.
                    I
                    placed the Google Stylesheet above my stylesheet. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>I followed all the suggestions in my “technically efficient” feedback. Furthermore, I made the
                    style.css
                    file smaller, and the fonts.css more accurate.</p>

                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>The CSM site didn’t have consistency in three pages (Explore, Exhibition Spaces and Special Events).
                    I
                    make some modifications in the css files to resolve this problem.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>All these pages are full width. I adjust the css’ files to make it more consistent. I deleted some
                    width,
                    and I tested many times to check if the modification worked. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>I could delete all styles, and sometimes it comes in my mind, however it is important to learn adjust
                    some legacy code. So I tried to adjust the styles instead to delete all. </p>

                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>The footer has three columns in the desktop version.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I created a new rule in the media query (min-width: 769px) to the footer has three columns. Then I
                    adjusted the items in the grid. I needed to replace the social medias icons because these icons were
                    inside the supported section and it didn’t allow to put these items in the second column in the
                    grid.
                </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The suggestion was: “The footer could be more neatly managed to reduce the height. There’s quite a
                    big
                    gap in the middle on desktop allowing for a three column layout.” Therefore, I create three columns
                    and
                    managed the items to fill this gap. The goal was to reduce the height, now it has 298px and before
                    it
                    was 427px.</p>

                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>The social medias icons are opening in other window as configured by JavaScript file.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I create a JavaScript file to add this behavior to the icons. I used “onclick” function and
                    “window.open”
                    to open a new window to share the CSM page in the social medias.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The level 1 of the course assignment suggested to add JavaScript to enhance the website. Thus, I
                    added
                    the social medias links because it wasn’t working (these were only icons in the Semester Project). I
                    would like to shift the checkbox hack by JavaScript functions to make the site more responsive, but
                    to
                    do that I need more time to change the name of the classes and adjust the details. For now I will
                    keep
                    the checkbox.</p>
