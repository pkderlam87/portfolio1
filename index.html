                <p>The site is now headless.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I placed the define headless command at the second line in the wp-config.php file</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>I tried to place the define headless command in other places, but it didn't work.</p>

                    bigger image.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I used the same code applied in the project exam: when the page content is being created, a
                    function populates an array with all the product images and loop over them making each one
                    clickable.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>Since the second or third version I wished I had this feature working, but I didn't know how to
                    implement it. I believe it is an important feature to expand the image when the user is buying
                    clothes. So I considered the user's perspective and its experience while in on-line shopping sites.

                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>The cart feature didn’t work at first: it had an error message due to the absence of the API call.
                    But now, it is working perfectly. It's placed in another file, called “cart.js”, as suggested by MJ
                    Phillip.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>In the beginning, I tried to export the API call, but the browser didn’t accept it: and an error
                    message would show up saying “MIME error”. So, I made another API call through the cart.js, and I
                    made some adjustments in order to handle the response. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The website is working based on API calls. I had no other choice if I wanted to have this job done as
                    it was expected to be.</p>

                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>Some features were assigned their own js file. The checkout.js had to break up into 3 files:
                    buyerForm, checkoutSuccess, and payment. The stock js was deleted because now the data comes from
                    API.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I've deleted some files as well as I've created new files to which I copied and pasted some
                    functions.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The checkout.js had 247 lines encompassing functions for purchase, form validation,
                    payment validation (credit card, VIPPS, etc). It was a bit confusing to handle due to its large
                    number of lines, it was difficult to find something whenever necessary.</p>

            <div class="text_report">
                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>The width compatibility with the width’s screens. A particular div was causing a horizontal scroll
                    bar
                    to show up. I also added to some pages an API-based product searching feature.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I replaced some styles to adjust to screens' width. As well, I used a search function to fetch the
                    products from the API.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>I was aware about the horizontal scroll bar issue, but I never had time enough to adjust the CSS
                    files. It was a mess. I even deleted some HTML files but I still couldn’t have these problems fixed.
                    In order to create the searching feature, I used the same code learned during the classes,
                    but to show the search results, I've create another function into the index.html file. I did it
                    because the getProducts function has an if statement that sorts the results. The search is working
                    on both the index.html and the products.html. As a work for the near future, I would like to
                    extend this feature to the whole site.

            <div class="text_report">
                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>The brand image in the footer was replaced by an h1, the social media icons, now, are support by
                    javascript functions and anchor tags were added to the following sections: products, about, and
                    contact.Finally, the footer is now responsive.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I replaced some styles in the CSS file in order to adjust the responsive design to the footer. For
                    the social media icons, I've create a socialMedia.js file in order to hold two functions and
                    allowing for opening the corresponding social media in a new window.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The footer wasn’t clean and simple. Instead, it was overloaded with information, colors, image,
                    icons, and anchors. I believe my initial lack of professional maturity made me a victim of the blind
                    desire of applying, at once, everything I was learning. I changed it in order to make it
                    responsive,clean and soft. About social media, my choice was to open it in another window so the the
                    user will be kept on the shopping site, then we won't depend on the user decision to comes back.</p>

                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>Each page presents some small changes aiming at improving the responsive design. The checkout page is
                    the best example: it wasn’t responsive at all.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I replaced some styles, I created some new media queries, and I adjust the size of the elements. I
                    tested it relentlessly, endless times and performed the fine grain modifications.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>It is essential to the front-end developer to think about the user experience and site look-and-feel.
                    During this year, I learned how to do that more easily. When I work on these cross-course projects,
                    I always want to delete all the CSS files and start from scratch. However, for the real-life
                    scenarios, I have to keep in mind that my time will be very limited, so I went for the patchwork
                    approach.</p>

            <div class="text_report">
                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>I create a loader because the API call has a delay, then the user needs to know that something is
                    happening.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I create the functions that encapsulate the API call and defined a div element to hold the loader
                    class. Then, I moved the JavaScript style and animation, to the rainydays’ style.css. I've adjusted
                    the
                    loader colors towards having more consistency. In the specific product page, I've created in the
                    html file a div element and assigned to it the loader class.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>I considered creating the loader class inside the .js files, but in the specific product page, the
                    function doesn’t have the same proposal as in the index or in the products pages. As a peculiar
                    page, I added a specific div class loader to the HTML file in order to wait for the API call
                    results.</p>

                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>

                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The feedback stated that “the links on the home page look more like headings than links. In the HTML,
                    they are headings as well. Might be best to keep the two separate” - to which I agree. At first, I
                    thought i should not use buttons because it didn’t have a JavaScript file associated. Now, I
                    understood it’s much better to use buttons than h3, even not having a JavaScript file.</p>

                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I deleted the @font-face rules because I’m using Google Fonts, and it isn’t necessary. I've created a
                    specific stylesheet to the fonts and font sizes because, eventually, it’s easier to change some
                    values. I placed the Google Stylesheet before my own stylesheet. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>

                    I made some modifications in the css files to resolve this problem.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>All these pages are full width. I adjusted the css’ files in order to make it more consistent. I
                    deleted some width definitions, and I tested it many times in order to confirm that the modification
                    worked. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>I could delete all the styles. It comes to my mind that it is important to learn how to maintain some
                    legacy code, so I tried to adjust the styles instead of deleting them. </p>

                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I created a new rule in the media query (min-width: 769px) in order to force the footer having three
                    columns then I adjusted the items in the grid. I needed to replace the social medias icons because
                    these icons were inside the supported section and it didn’t allow to put these items in the second
                    column in the grid.
                </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The suggestion was: “The footer could be more neatly managed to reduce the height. There’s quite a
                    big gap in the middle of the desktop version allowing for a three column layout.” Therefore, I
                    create three columns and managed the items so they could fill in this gap. The goal was to reduce
                    the height, now it has 298px in contrast to its previous 427px.</p>

                <p>I create a JavaScript file to handle this behavior for the icons. I used the “onclick” function and
                    the “window.open” to open a new window whose purpose is to share the CSM page on the social media.
                </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way:</h5>
                <p>The level 1 of the course assignment suggested to add JavaScript to enhance the website. Thus, I
                    added the social medias links because it wasn’t working (these were only icons in the Semester
                    Project). I would like to replace the checkbox hacking by JavaScript functions in order to make the
                    site more responsive, but, in order to achieve that, I need more time to to adjust some details. For
                    now, I will just keep the checkbox behavior as it is.</p>

                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>In the corresponding .js files the “var” keyword was used for some variable declarations. I replaced
                    them by “let” or “const”.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I used the search in the Visual Studio Code in order to locate them. I analysed one by one the
                    results.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way: </h5>
                <p>I would like to use global variables for some functions, but I can use “let” and “const” for that.
                    For the first version, I completely missed that.</p>

            <div class="text_report">
                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>A new feature was added in order to allow for searching post in the index page.</p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I used the same function available in the listOfPosts.js, but in this case I needed to create a
                    specific place to show the search results.</p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way: </h5>
                <p>The index page presents a slider show area. If I used the same place and function for both things, it
                    would be returning the data before the timeline carousel was available, it could create a misleading
                    scenario to the user regarding the search results and the postings on the timeline.</p>

            <h3>Menu by year category <span class="more_less"><i class="far fa-plus-square"></i></span></h3>
            <div class="text_report">
                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>I added a menu grouping information by year in the desktop version as any other blog. </p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I used the categories example presented in the CSM course. The years in the section are static, but
                    the titles of the posts are dynamic. To achieve that, I implemented two loops: one to go through the
                    list of years and the other to go through the API and write the post titles in HTML. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way: </h5>
                <p>I would like to implement it by loading dynamic years also, however, fist I implemented the dynamical
                    titles, since this feature was in my project already and I had tried it before. Maybe there is a
                    easier way to do that, but for now I couldn’t think of another solution.</p>

            <h3>Post the data from the contact form to WordPress <span class="more_less"><i
                        class="far fa-plus-square"></i></span></h3>
            <div class="text_report">
                <h5>What was changed:</h5>
                <p>The form is sent to the WordPress backend. I can access the data inside the “inbound messages” in the
                    flamingo framework. The user receives the same error messages as before, but the success message
                    comes as an API response. I added an image to this message too. </p>
                <h5>How I changed it:</h5>
                <p>I got some help from Professor MJ Phillip and from my colleagues who provided me with good sources of
                    research. So I used the Mészáros Róbert article to implement this feature. To handle the file image
                    I used the following article:
                    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#supplying_request_options.
                    Then, I used the facilities of the Contact Form 7 plugin to adjust the minimum length to the fields.
                    As well, the messages come from as an API response. The API provides with an “error_id” to show the
                    corresponding error message. This time, I’m using switch statements instead the if statements. </p>
                <h5>Why I did it that way: </h5>
                <p>The post method is new for me, meaning that I’m still learning what I can do or not. I made some
                    adjustments to the Mészáros Róbert function, but the essence come from the his article. I tried to
                    access the data from the form, but it was possible only with the flamingo plugin, ins this regard,
                    my colleague (James Farmer) helped me. My merit was all about using the Contact Form 7 to handle the
                    success and error messages. I would like to learn more about this matter. Nevertheless, I could make
                    my functions more readable and more maintainable</p>
